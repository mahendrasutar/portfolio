## Problem Statement

A week after my friend lost his dog, he shared that it had suffered from Lyme Disease. During the illness, he couldn't find proper
veterinary care or emergency services, and despite treatment from a local vet, the pet didn't survive.
This made me realize the need for a comprehensive pet care app covering adoption, healthcare, emergency services, food, and
overall pet needs.

## Objectives & Goals

-   **To create an all-in-one platform that encourages responsible
pet adoption and simplifies pet care by providing easy access
to resources, veterinary services, and pet-related products.** 
-   **To increase pet adoptions, simplify pet care, enhance user
engagement, and foster a supportive community for pet
lovers.**

## Research

The survey included questions on pet adoption experiences, challenges in finding resources, and preferences for app features.

## Observations

## User needs

- Filters for pet type, age, breed, and location for tailored adoption options.
- Vet locators, grooming centers, and pet care tips all in one place.

By positioning the Vet Hospital option in the center, Pet Wise ensures quick access during
emergencies, as it is a critical feature for pet health. The center placement improves accessibility,
being easy to tap with the thumb, and aligns with visual hierarchy to highlight its importance. This
design choice promotes timely care and better health outcomes for pets.

## My Learnings From This Project

I take great pride in the outcome of this project, seeing it as a continuous
journey of valuable learning experiences.

**Prioritizing User Preferences:** Recognizing the significance of user habits and
preferences became evident. Users particularly value features such as swiping
and inline bookmarking, enhancing their reading experience.

**Emphasis on User Testing:** Early and consistent user testing proved
indispensable. Valuable insights from user feedback identified issues in the initial
design, prompting necessary adjustments for improved usability.

**Seeking Inspiration:** Encountering challenges throughout the project, I found
inspiration by studying existing apps and engaging in discussions with users to
overcome obstacles.

**Skillset Enhancement:** This project deepened my understanding of the UX design
process and allowed me to refine my skills in user interviews, research, analysis,
and more. It served as a platform for continuous skill development.

Thanks for reading, until next time!
